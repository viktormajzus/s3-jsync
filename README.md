### Build it and enjoy!

### Recommended:
Add the folder to your Path environment variable:
Windows Key -> Edit the system environment variables -> Environment variables -> Select Path -> Press Edit -> New -> C:\PATH\TO\s3-jsync folder

## Usage Instructions

### Configuration
You will need to set the following environment variables to their respective values:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_KEY`
- `AWS_REGION`

You can do so with these commands:

- **Linux**:
  ```
  export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA....MT
  export AWS_SECRET_KEY=8u....zq
  export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
  ```
- **Windows**:
  ```
  setx AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID AKIA....MT
  setx AWS_SECRET_KEY 8u....zq
  setx AWS_REGION us-east-1
  ```
Note that the above command for windows will set the variables permanently. If you want to use these variables only in the current session, use `set` instead of `setx`

You can also change the environment variables by going to:

Windows Key -> Edit the system environment variables -> Environment variables -> Select Path -> Press Edit -> New -> C:\PATH\TO\s3-jsync folder

### Upload Files
`s3-jsync put <SOURCE/FOLDER> <DESTINATION_BUCKET>`

Will upload every single file within this folder into the destination bucket.

**WARNING** Overwrites files based on their date modified

### Download Files
`s3-jsync get <SOURCE_BUCKET> <DESTINATION_FOLDER>`

Downloads files from the source bucket to the destination folder.

**WARNING** Overwrites files based on their date modified

### List buckets
`s3-jsync list -b`

Lists every bucket that the user (with the access key) has access to see

### List objects
`s3-jsync list -o <SOURCE_BUCKET>`

Lists every object within a specified bucket

### Wipe a bucket
`s3-jsync delete <DESTINATION_BUCKET>`

**WARNING** Dangerous command, try not to use it, unless you know what you're doing

`s3-jsync help`

`s3-jsync --help`
